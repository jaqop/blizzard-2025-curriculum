# 🎮 Blizzard 2025 Gold Standard Curriculum  
*A Modern Career Development Framework for Game Engine & Systems Programmers*  

A modern, milestone-driven reading list for aspiring game engine and systems programmers.  
This curriculum modernizes the classic **Blizzard Software Engineering Reading List** for 2025, focusing on **Modern C++**, **game architecture patterns**, and **professional engineering habits**.  

---

## 📖 Origins & Philosophy  

This curriculum is a modern homage to the original **Blizzard Software Engineering Reading List** curated by *Jay Baxter* circa 2009.  
That list was legendary for its rigorous approach to crafting well-rounded, professional C++ engineers within a game development context.  

Our goal with this 2025 edition is to **honor the spirit and intent** of Baxter’s original vision —  
**deep C++ mastery, software engineering fundamentals, and professional craftsmanship** —  
while radically updating its contents for the contemporary era.  

---

## 🚀 What's New in the 2025 Edition?  

The original list was a product of its time, focused on **C++98** and the tools of that era.  
To work effectively in 2025, the list required a significant evolution:  

| Original Focus (2009) | Modernized Focus (2025) |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **C++98 / "C with Classes"** | **Modern C++ (C++17/20):** RAII, smart pointers, move semantics, lambdas |
| **General Software Engineering** | **Game-Engine Specialization:** Data-Oriented Design, ECS, engine architecture, multiplayer |
| **Theoretical Foundations** | **Applied Practice:** Projects integrated at every tier |
| **Individual Contribution** | **Technical Leadership:** Modern senior IC skills (*The Staff Engineer’s Path*) |

This list is our attempt to answer the question:  
**“What would a Jay Baxter–style curriculum look like if it were created today?”**  

It is a **living document.** We will continue to update it as our industry evolves.

## 📝 Note on Improvements  

This list stays **as close as possible** to Jay Baxter’s 2009 vision —  
structured tiers, deep C++ focus, and professional engineering mindset.  

We added a few **pluses** based on **advice from real AAA developers**:  

- ✅ **SDL2 or Raylib projects** → force deeper low-level understanding.  
- ✅ **Effective Modern C++ & Professional C++** → reflect post-C++11 language revolutions.  
- ✅ **Game Engine Architecture** → provides the “big picture” every AAA developer needs.  
- ✅ **Data-Oriented Design** → essential for modern, high-performance engines.  
- ✅ **The Staff Engineer’s Path** → guidance for senior IC leadership, reflecting today’s AAA studio expectations.  

These additions ensure the curriculum **produces developers ready for real AAA game studios in 2025**.
