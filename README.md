Blizzard 2025 Gold Standard Curriculum üéÆ

A modern, milestone-driven reading list for aspiring game engine and systems programmers. This curriculum modernizes the classic Blizzard Software Engineering reading list for 2025, focusing on Modern C++, game architecture patterns, and professional engineering habits.

Origins & Philosophy

This curriculum is a modern homage to the original Blizzard Software Engineering Reading List curated by Jay Baxter circa 2009. That list was legendary for its rigorous approach to crafting well-rounded, professional C++ engineers within a game development context.

Our goal with this 2025 edition is to honor the spirit and intent of Baxter's original vision‚Äîdeep C++ mastery, software engineering fundamentals, and professional craftsmanship‚Äîwhile radically updating its contents for the contemporary era.

What's New in the 2025 Edition?

The original list was a product of its time, focused on C++98 and the tools of that era. To work effectively in 2025, the list required a significant evolution:
Original Focus (c. 2009)	Modernized Focus (2025)
C++98 / "C with Classes"	Modern C++ (C++17/20): RAII, smart pointers, move semantics, lambdas.
General Software Engineering	Game-Engine Specialization: Data-Oriented Design, engine architecture, multiplayer.
Theoretical Foundations	Applied Practice: Paired with hands-on projects at every tier.
Individual Contribution	Technical Leadership: Incorporates modern senior IC skills (The Staff Engineer's Path).

This list is our attempt to answer the question: "What would a Jay Baxter-style curriculum look like if it were created today?"

It is a living document. We will continue to update it as our industry evolves.

The Curriculum

The list is structured as a progressive journey from foundational principles to architectural mastery. Each tier represents a career stage, defined by key books to internalize and a project to demonstrate mastery.

Tier 1: Associate Developer (0‚Äì2 Years)

Goal: Achieve fluency in Modern C++ and establish professional engineering habits.

Keystone Reads

    Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup) ‚Äì The comprehensive workbook.

    The Pragmatic Programmer (David Thomas & Andrew Hunt) ‚Äì Professional craftsman mindset.

    The Mythical Man-Month (Frederick P. Brooks Jr.) ‚Äì Timeless lessons on software projects.

üõ†Ô∏è Proof of Mastery: The Project

Build a portfolio of small, complete 2D games using a library like SFML or SDL.

Tier 2: Mid-Level Developer (2‚Äì5 Years)

Goal: Master C++ idiomatics, design patterns, and core game engine architecture.

Keystone Reads

How to Use This List

    Read Progressively. Each tier builds on the last. Do not skip ahead.

    Build the Projects. Knowledge without application is forgotten. The projects are non-optional proof of understanding.

    Seek Depth. This list shows the keystone milestones. For deeper study on a topic, explore the books referenced in the footnotes of these texts.
