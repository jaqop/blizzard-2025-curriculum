# 🎮 Blizzard 2025 Gold Standard Curriculum
*A Modern Career Development Framework for Game Engine & Systems Programmers*

A modern, milestone-driven reading list for aspiring game engine and systems programmers.  
This curriculum modernizes the classic Blizzard Software Engineering reading list for 2025, focusing on **Modern C++**, **game architecture patterns**, and **professional engineering habits**.

---

## 📖 Origins & Philosophy

This curriculum is a modern homage to the original **Blizzard Software Engineering Reading List** curated by *Jay Baxter* circa 2009.  
That list was legendary for its rigorous approach to crafting well-rounded, professional C++ engineers within a game development context.

Our goal with this 2025 edition is to **honor the spirit and intent** of Baxter's original vision —  
*deep C++ mastery, software engineering fundamentals, and professional craftsmanship* —  
while radically updating its contents for the contemporary era.

## 🚀 What's New in the 2025 Edition?

The original list was a product of its time, focused on **C++98** and the tools of that era.  
To work effectively in 2025, the list required a significant evolution:

| Original Focus (2009) | Modernized Focus (2025) |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **C++98 / "C with Classes"** | **Modern C++ (C++17/20):** RAII, smart pointers, move semantics, lambdas |
| **General Software Engineering** | **Game-Engine Specialization:** Data-Oriented Design, engine architecture, multiplayer |
| **Theoretical Foundations** | **Applied Practice:** Projects integrated at every tier |
| **Individual Contribution** | **Technical Leadership:** Modern senior IC skills (*The Staff Engineer's Path*) |

This list is our attempt to answer the question:  
**“What would a Jay Baxter–style curriculum look like if it were created today?”**

It is a **living document.** We will continue to update it as our industry evolves.

📌 **Project:** Develop a multiplayer prototype with optimized systems (networking, concurrency, DOD).  

---

## ⚡ Specialization Tracks

After completing **Tier 2**, engineers may pursue one or more specialization tracks. These extend expertise beyond the shared core into domains vital for AAA-scale development.

---

### 🔹 Track A: Distributed Systems & Online Infrastructure
For engineers building multiplayer, live-service, or backend systems.

- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** — *Martin Kleppmann*  
- **Production-Ready Microservices** — *Susan J. Fowler*  

---

### 🔹 Track B: Low-Level Graphics & Rendering
For engineers working on rendering, graphics APIs, and performance-critical engine code.

- **Foundations of Game Engine Development, Vol. 2: Rendering** — *Eric Lengyel*  
- **Vulkan Programming Guide** — *Graham Sellers*  
  OR  
  **Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12** — *Frank Luna*  
- **Real-Time Rendering (4th Edition)** — *Tomas Akenine-Möller et al.*  

---

### 🔹 Track C: Production Engineering & DevOps
For engineers optimizing pipelines, infrastructure, and collaboration at scale.

- **The DevOps Handbook** — *Gene Kim et al.*  
- **Infrastructure as Code** — *Kief Morris*  
- **Practical Skills & Tools:**  
  - **Perforce Helix Core** → branching, streams, handling large binaries  
  - **Git LFS** → versioning large assets in Git  
  - **Docker / Kubernetes** → containerization and orchestration  
  - **CI/CD Platforms** (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, TeamCity)

## 🗝️ How to Use This Curriculum

1. **Master the Core.** The three tiers are the non-negotiable foundation.  
2. **Choose Your Track.** After Tier 2, specialize based on your career goals and team needs.  
3. **Prove Through Projects.** Each tier requires hands-on projects — knowledge without application fades.  
4. **Evolve Continuously.** This is a living curriculum. As tools and practices evolve, so should you.
